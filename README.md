# Psychopomps of Soluna
This is an archive of a GameMaker project that I created back in 2016, for a Game Design class's final. As I have not used GameMaker since then, I have included the executable so that people can easily install and play the game. There is a help button with instructions once you've launched the game. Please enjoy!

I followed Sergent Indie's tutorials on Youtube to create this game, adjusting as needed for the character portraits and sprites.
As a side note, the assets are pretty old now and these characters no longer look the way they do in these games. Apologies for the old art style, I promise I'm better now.
